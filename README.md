# Fishing Game in Python
This is a fishing game I made in Python using PyGame during my first year at Univeristy, it has features such as catching/selling fish, fishing rod durability, money and a fishing rod store.

When you hook onto a fish a circle will show up on the water, the circle radius is determined by the rarity of the fish. Keep your cursor within the circle while it moves around the water to catch the fish.
